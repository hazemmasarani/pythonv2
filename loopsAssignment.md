# Mastering Python Loops Assignment

## Exercise 1: Basic Loop Structures

Understanding the basics of loops is essential for iteration in Python.

- **Task 1.1:** Write a `while` loop that prints the numbers 1 through 10.
- **Task 1.2:** Write a `for` loop that prints each character in the string `"Python"`.
- **Task 1.3:** Create a `for` loop that iterates over a list of numbers and prints the square of each number.


## Exercise 2: Controlling Loop Flow

`break` and `continue` statements can modify the flow of loops.

- **Task 2.1:** Write a `while` loop that stops printing numbers from 1 to 10 when the number reaches 7 using the `break` statement.
- **Task 2.2:** Write a `for` loop that skips printing the number 5 when iterating over numbers 1 through 10 using the `continue` statement.

## Exercise 3: Nested Loops

Nested loops allow for more complex iterations and data processing.

grid_list = [
[[0,0],[0,1],[0,2]],
[[1,0],[1,1],[1,2]],
[[2,0],[2,1],[2,2]]
]
_CHALLENGE_

- **Task 3.1:** Write a nested `for` loop that prints a 3x3 grid of numbers (i.e., rows and columns of numbers from 0 to 2).
  ^^ skip task 3.1
- **Task 3.2:** Using nested loops, write a program to print the multiplication table for numbers 1 through 5.

## Exercise 4: Looping with Ranges

The `range()` function is a useful tool for generating sequences of numbers in loops.

- **Task 4.1:** Write a `for` loop that prints only the even numbers from 1 to 20 using the `range()` function.
- **Task 4.2:** Write a `for` loop that counts down from 10 to 1 using the `range()` function.

## Exercise 5: Real-World Applications of Loops

Loops can be applied in real-world scenarios for tasks like data processing or automation.

- **Task 5.1:** Write a `for` loop that asks the user to input 5 different names and stores them in a list. Then, print each name.
- **Task 5.2:** Write a `while` loop that keeps asking the user to guess a secret number until they get it right. Use `break` when they guess correctly.
