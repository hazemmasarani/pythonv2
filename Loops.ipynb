    "# Loops in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Objectives\n",
    "- Understand the concept and application of loops in Python.\n",
    "- Learn the differences and use cases of `while` and `for` loops.\n",
    "- Explore how to control loops using `break` and `continue`.\n",
    "- Investigate the concept and utility of nested loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Understanding While and For Loops\n",
    "Loops enable the execution of a code block multiple times until a condition is met.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### While Loop\n",
    "A `while` loop runs as long as a condition is True.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "    print(\"Count:\", count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This code increments and prints a counter until it reaches 5.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### For Loop\n",
    "A `for` loop iterates over a sequence of elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "fruits = [\"apple\", \"banana\", \"cherry\"]\n",
    "for fruit in fruits:\n",
    "    print(fruit)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This loop prints each fruit in the `fruits` list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Controlling Loops with Break and Continue\n",
    "`break` and `continue` control the flow within loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Break Statement\n",
    "The `break` statement exits the loop prematurely.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "count = 0\n",
    "while count < 5:\n",
    "    print(\"Count:\", count)\n",
    "    count += 1\n",
    "    if count == 3:\n",
    "        break\n",
    "```\n",
    "This loop stops when `count` reaches 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Continue Statement\n",
    "The `continue` statement skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for num in range(10):\n",
    "    if num % 2 == 0:\n",
    "        continue\n",
    "    print(num)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This loop prints only odd numbers from 0 to 9.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Nesting Loops\n",
    "Nested loops are loops within loops, allowing for complex iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for i in range(3):\n",
    "    for j in range(2):\n",
    "        print(i, j)\n",
    "```\n",
    "This code prints pairs of numbers, demonstrating two levels of looping.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "- Loops in Python are used for repetitive tasks.\n",
    "- `while` loops run based on a condition, and `for` loops iterate over sequences.\n",
    "- `break` and `continue` control the loop execution.\n",
    "- Nested loops facilitate multi-dimensional iterations.\n"
